# MCutie: MQTT Server Logger and Client
MCutie provides a web client and API to log and chart MQTT sensor data.
MCutie should run concurrently with an MQTT broker such as mosquitto.

## Deploying on a Raspberry Pi
1. Allow the port for the client: `sudo ufw allow 80`.
2. Allow the port for the server: `sudo ufw allow 5000`.
3. Set up the MQTT broker `sudo apt install mosquitto`.
    * You should [enable passwords and users](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-the-mosquitto-mqtt-messaging-broker-on-ubuntu-16-04).
4. Change `./backend/.env` to reflect the credentials of the broker.
5. Install sqlite3: `sudo apt-get install sqlite3`.
5. Change `./client/src/util.js` to reflect credentials of the Raspberry Pi.
6. Rebuild the client: `cd client` then `npm run build`.
7. Launch the App from the root directory with `npm run prod`.
8. You should be able to see the App running on the local network from the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

# Frontend Client
* React.js

## Using .env
A sample .env file has been included in the `client/` folder.
* `PORT`: port to run the client server on. The default port for `HTTP` is 80.
* `IPADDRESS`: Ip address of the device running the server. You can get this on Linux using `ifconfig` and Windows using `ipconfig`.

## Using `client/src/util.js`
The variables defined in `util.js` should match those used by the backend server.
The only variables you should change are `const IPADDRESS` and `const PORT`.
* `const IPADDRESS`: This should match the Ip address of the device running the backend server.
* `const PORT`: This should match the port of the backend server.


## Changing Colors
Most components are colored by `src/css/stylesheet.css`. 
Chart colors are defined in `src/util.js`. 
You can use another [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) color scheme or change the color codes to your liking. 
The default color scheme is based on [Solarized Dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized_(color_scheme)).

# Backend Server
* SQlite3
* Sequelize
* Express.js

The server is an MQTT client. The server listens on subscribed topics and records those messages to an SQLite3 database.

The server also manages a REST API to view logged MQTT msgs and can update subscriptions.

For `POST` and `DELETE` requests, use the x-www-form-urlencoded content policy.

## Using .env
A sample .env file has been included in the `backend/` folder.
* `DB_HOST`: database host, the intended database is sqlite3 
* `MQTT_BROKER`: mqtt broker, this app is intended to be run on the same machine as your broker.
* `MQTT_CLIENTID`: mqtt client id, pick something unique
* `MQTT_USERNAME/MQTT_PASSWORD`: if you have certification set up on your mqtt broker, put your username/password here.
* `MQTT_FLOAT_RES`: For floating point incoming data, checks the data against the rule: (PreviousData - CurrentData > FloatResoltuion) ? addToDataBase : dontAddToDataBase
* `MQTT_INT_RES`: For integer incoming data, checks the data against the rule: (PreviousData - CurrentData > IntResoltuion) ? addToDataBase : dontAddToDataBase
* `LOGLEVEL`: log level, most stuff is on debug, anything breaking will be on info and below.
* `PORT`: port to run the backend server on. This should align with the port listed in `client/src/util.js`.
* `IPADDRESS`: Ip address of the device running the server. You can get this on Linux using `ifconfig` and Windows using `ipconfig`.

# Web Socket Reference

## Live Data
The backend websocket will query the database and send data to the frontend websocket based on an `EventEmitter` called `mqttEmitter`.
The `mqttEmitter` events are usually triggered whenever a new MQTT message is inserted into the databse.
But the `mqttEmitter` event will also sometimes be triggered to intialize data on the websocket.

A typical websocket connection will happen in the following fashion:
1. Client connects to websocket. The server triggeres an intial event so that the websocket sends the current list of topics.
2. Client requests a live topic. The server triggers an event for the websock to send the initial set of data for the live topic.
3. When a new MQTT message is received, the `mqttEmitter` event is triggered which will send any new data to the client over the websocket.

## Websocket Requests and Responses
* The backend websocket is at route `/live/`

### Client wants to publish data
Client sends:
```javascript
{
  request: "publish",
  payload: {
    topic: "topic",
    message: "message",
    qos: "qos" // optional
  }
}
```
Server sends message over MQTT.

### Client requests data fro a live topic
To start receiving live data, the Client sends:
```javascript
{
  request: "live",
  payload: {
    topic: "topic"
  }
}
```

Server sends data for the live topic and will continue to send data for that live topic until a new live topic is chosen.
```javascript
{
  request: "newdata",
  payload:[{
    id: 0,
    message: "message",
    topic: "topic",
    createdAt: "2021-01-21T10:57:56.379Z"
   },{
    id: 1,
    message: "message",
    topic: "topic",
    createdAt: "2021-01-21T10:57:56.38Z"
   }]
}
```

### Server wants to update the clients topic list
Server sends the json. This is unprompted and will happen anytime the server detects a new topic in the database.
```javascript
{
  request: "newtopic",
  payload: [{topic: "newtopic"}, {topic: "newtopic2"}]
}
```
